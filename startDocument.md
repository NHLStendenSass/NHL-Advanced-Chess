## 2. Application Description

A group of student wants to play chess that is different from normal. Students want to play chess using voice commands and use a random set of rules through a DnD dice.

The method that the application will be developed with is (MVVM) Model–view–viewmodel. this is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view). **(3)**

## 7. Features

The Moscow method was used for this project to separate the various functionalities and determine which were more important than others. We used the Moscow method to separate the various functionalities within the various priorities.
This is what we came up with after conducting research and considering various functionalities:

### 7.1 Specifications

1. C# .NET 6.
2. Framework Monogame.
3. MVVM pattern.

### 7.2 Moscow

##### Must Have:

- Receiving input from user and parsing to the application.(Mouse input)
- Normal chess board with working chess pieces.
- Voice commands to move chess pieces. (Ex: "D4 move to F2")
- Animation for chess piece movement.
- 1 vs 1 locally from one computer.
- DnD dice to change the rule from classic one (Ex: D20 ICOSAHEDRON dice lands on 18, the game will loop 18 alive pieces from the user thus choosing the piece that would have special ability, that piece is now granted a special move to a random empty tile)


##### Should Have:

- Voice command to navigate through game.

##### Could Have:

- Online multiplayer through different computer.
- Scoreboard records win/loss from different user.
- Playing against computer.
- Different chess piece capture animation.

##### Will Not Have:
